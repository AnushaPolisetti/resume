   <h2>Projects</h2>
   <h4>AUTOMATIC SOLAR STREET LIGHTS</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>In this project we study the solar street lighting system uses the photovoltaic technology to convert the sunlight into DC electricity through solar cells.</li>
    <li>The generated electricity can either be used directly during the day or may not be stored in the batteries for use during night hours.</li>
   </ul>
   <h4>FAST BINARY COUNTERS AND COMPRESSORS GENERATED BY SORTING NETWORK</h4>
   <ul>
    <li>In this project, a new binary counter design method based on a sorting network is proposed, and we construct (7,3), (15,4) counters based on this min max sorting method.</li>
    <li>Compressors and proposed counters are more flexible than existing design because it achieves less delay when the speed is critical and performs is better in ADP.</li>
  </ul>
  <H4>FLIGHT FARE PREDICTION</H4>
  <ul>
    <li>In this project, a predictive model will be created by applying to the collected historical data of flights. </li>
    <li>This system will helps to give idea to the people about the trends that prices follow and also provide a predicted price value which they can refer to before booking their flight tickets to save money.</li>
  </ul>
